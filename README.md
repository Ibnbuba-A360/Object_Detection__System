# Object Detection System

This project is a real-time object detection system that leverages deep learning (YOLO) and a KivyMD-based graphical user interface. It is designed to detect and recognize objects from live video streams with high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection:** Processes video frames at high speed using YOLO.
- **User Interface:** Built with PyQt6 for an intuitive experience.
- **Robust Performance:** Optimized for various hardware, including desktops and edge devices.
